# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
I am building a model to predict customer churn 



## Introduction
 
### In today's world of machine learning, most companies build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers.We have been tasked to create a prediction model for a telecommunication company to help predict id a customer will churn or not. We are to also help them uderstand their data and know what factors affect the rate at which customers stop using their network to understand their data.

## CRISP DM Process
### To successfully build my model and predict customer churn, I will use the CRISP-DM framework.Explained below is the CRISP-DM process including all the steps i have taken to successfully build my model

### Step 1: Data Collection
Description of the data collection process.
### 3 datasets were provided for this project.
### I loaded the first dataset of 3000 records from a database I accessed remotely.
SERVER_NAME=dap-projects-database.database.windows.net
USER=LP2_project
PASSWORD=Stat$AndD@t@Rul3
DATABASE_NAME=dapDB
TABLE_NAME=dbo.LP2_Telco_churn_first_3000

### To load the second data, I downloaded it from a github repository in a file called LP2_Telco_Churn-second=2000.csv.
### Here is the github repository  https://github.com/Azubi-Africa/Career_Accelerator_LP2-Classifcation/tree/main

### To load the third data, which is my testing data, I downoaded it from a one drive in a file named Telco-churn-last-2000.xlsx
### Here is the one drive link https://azubiafrica-my.sharepoint.com/personal/teachops_azubiafrica_org/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fteachops%5Fazubiafrica%5Forg%2FDocuments%2FCareer%20Accelerator%20Data%5FSets%2FLP2%20Datasets&ga=1

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Description of the data preprocessing steps.

### Step 3: Model Training
Description of how the model is trained.
